Keybind script for JC2-MP version 1.0 by guyboy

You can bind commands to keys using this script. Do /bind for quick help.

Detailed help:

To bind a key, do /bind followed by a space, followed by the command you want to bind it to.
For example: /bind /tp airport
or: /bind /woet
You will then be prompted to press a key to bind that command to.

Next time you press that key, it will execute that command, be it a client-side or server-side command.

To unbind a key, enter the command /unbind, then press the key you want to unbind from.
To return a list of bound commands, do /list
To unbind all keys, do /unbindall
